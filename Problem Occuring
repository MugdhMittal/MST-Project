The problem with repair tree occurs when we try to replace an already existing edge with a reduced weight edge.
Say an edge is there in the mst 1 2 100. The mst has root 3.
Now if i add an edge 1 2 50 at time 1000 and then remove the same edge at time 2000 then
it should return the original mst before adding the edge however currently it returns the next best edge
(which might be say 2 3 150) instead of 1 2 100 
Rest all repair is fine
